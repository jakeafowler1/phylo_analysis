# phylo_analysis
Depositions of python code I used for retrieving sequences from alternate databases and assigning taxonomic information from GTDB bac120 into my databases.

This python script was generated to cross-reference from different files in the Genome Taxonomy DataBase (GTDB) for the purpose of phylogenetic analyses of bacterial proteins in my PhD project.
